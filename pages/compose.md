# Composition

So far we are working on a single visualisation, but we can also create multiple visualisation through the following methods.

- **Facet**: Create small multiple visulisation across rows or columns.
- **Layer**: Overlay one visualisation on another.
- **Concat**: Add charts to each other - horizontally or vertically.
- **Repeat**: Repeat the same visualisation but using different fields.
