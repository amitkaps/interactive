# Types of Data 

> “Data is a clue to the end-truth” - Josh Smith

We are focussed on visualising quantitative data. Lets understand the different scales of measures we have for quantiative data.

Let's take an example. Say you want to measure temperature in a room. You can do it in four different ways.

- **Nominal**: Nice, Pleasant, Cool
- **Ordinal**: Hot, Warm, Cold
- **Interval**: 30 °C, 40 °C, 80 °C 
- **Ratio**: 30 K, 40 K, 50 K 

We can think of the role of each of these scales of measure as following:

- **Nominal**: Classification, Membership
- **Ordinal**: Comparison, Levels
- **Interval**: Difference, Affinity 
- **Ratio**: Magnitude, Amount
  
And in terms of mathematical operation that can be performed in each of these types:
 
- **Nominal**: = , !=
- **Ordinal**: =, !=, >, <
- **Interval**: =, !=, >, <, -, % of diff 
- **Ratio**: =, !=, >, <, -, +, %

Here are some more common examples for each type:
  
- **Nominal** e.g. Finance, HR, Marketing
- **Ordinal** e.g. Good, Better, Best
- **Interval** (zero arbitrary) e.g. dates, location, direction, percentages
- **Ratio** (zero fixed) e.g. length, mass, sales

In Visdown, we will be using the following four types:
- Nominal or **N**
- Ordinal or **O**
- Temporal or **T** (Interval scale for Time)
- Quantitative or **Q** (Ratio Scale)
